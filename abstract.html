							<p>Heart disease is one of the complex diseases and globally many people suffered from this
disease. On time and efficient identification of heart disease plays a key role in healthcare, particularly
in the field of cardiology. In this article, we proposed an efficient and accurate system to diagnosis heart
disease and the system is based on machine learning techniques. The system is developed based on
classification algorithms includes Support vector machine, Logistic regression, Artificial neural network,
K-nearest neighbor, Na√Øve bays, and Decision tree while standard features selection algorithms have been
used such as Relief, Minimal redundancy maximal relevance, Least absolute shrinkage selection operator
and Local learning for removing irrelevant and redundant features. We also proposed novel fast conditional
mutual information feature selection algorithm to solve feature selection problem. The features selection
algorithms are used for features selection to increase the classification accuracy and reduce the execution time
of classification system. Furthermore, the leave one subject out cross-validation method has been used for
learning the best practices of model assessment and for hyperparameter tuning. The performance measuring
metrics are used for assessment of the performances of the classifiers. The performances of the classifiers
have been checked on the selected features as selected by features selection algorithms. The experimental
results show that the proposed feature selection algorithm (FCMIM) is feasible with classifier support vector
machine for designing a high-level intelligent system to identify heart disease. The suggested diagnosis
system (FCMIM-SVM) achieved good accuracy as compared to previously proposed methods. Additionally,
the proposed system can easily be implemented in healthcare for the identification of heart disease.</p>
