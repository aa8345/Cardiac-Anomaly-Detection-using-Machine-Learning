							<p>In this study, an efficient machine learning based diagnosis system has been developed for the diagnosis of heart disease. Machine learning classifiers include LR, K-NN, ANN, SVM, NB, and DT are used in the designing of the system. Four standard feature selection algorithms including Relief, MRMR, LASSO, LLBFS, and proposed a novel feature selection algorithm FCMIM used to solve feature selection problem. LOSO cross-validation method is used in the system for the best hyperparameters selection. The system is tested on Cleveland heart disease dataset. Furthermore, performance evaluation metrics are used to check the performance of the identification system. According to Table 15 the specificity of ANN classifier is best on Relief FS algorithm as compared to the specificity of MRMR, LASSO, LLBFS, and FCMIM feature selection algorithms. Therefore for ANN with relief is the best predictive system for detection of healthy people. The sensitivity of classifier NB on selected features set by LASSO FS algorithm also gives the best result as compared to the sensitivity values of Relief FS algorithm with classifier SVM (linear). The classifier Logistic Regression MCC is 91% on selected features selected by FCMIM FS algorithm. The processing time of Logistic Regression with Relief, LASSO, FCMIM and LLBFS FS algorithm best as compared to MRMR FS algorithms, and others classifiers. Thus the experimental results show that the proposed features selection algorithm select features that are more effective and obtains high classification accuracy than the standard feature selection algorithms. According to feature selection algorithms, the most important and suitable features are Thallium Scan type chest pain and Exercise-induced Angina. All FS algorithms results show that the feature Fasting blood sugar (FBS) is not a suitable heart disease diagnosis. The accuracy of SVM with the proposed feature selection algorithm (FCMIM) is 92.37%</p>
